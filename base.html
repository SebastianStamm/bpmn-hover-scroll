  <h1>A simple flow in BPMN</h1>
  <p>Let’s begin our BPMN tutorial with a rather simple process diagram:</p>

  <div id="diagram-container"></div>

  <p>
    This diagram shows a simple process triggered by someone being hungry. The
    result is that someone must shop for groceries and prepare a meal. After
    that, someone will eat the meal and have his or her hunger satisfied.
  </p>

  <h3>Best Practice: Naming Conventions</h3>
  <p>
    When naming tasks, we try to adhere to the object-orientated design
    principle of using the [verb] + [object] pattern. We would say “acquire
    groceries,” for example, not “first take care of shopping for groceries.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Events refer to something that has already happened regardless of the
    process (if they are catching events) or as a result of the process (if they
    are throwing events). For this reason, we use the [object] and make the
    [verb] passive in voice, so we write “hunger noticed.” BPMN does not require
    you to model start and end events for a process – you can leave them out –
    but <b>if</b> you model a start event, you must model an end event for each
    path. The same is true for end events, which require start events. We always
    create our models with start and end events for two reasons: first, that way
    it’s possible to determine the process trigger, and second, you can describe
    the final status of each path end. We only sometimes abandon this practice
    with sub-processes. More on this later.

  <h1>Examples</h1>

  <script>
    (async () => {
      const xml = await fetch("./simple.bpmn");

      const viewer = new BpmnJS({ container: "#diagram-container" });
      viewer.importXML(await xml.text());
    })();
  </script>
</body>
